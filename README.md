<p>During Quarantine I have been very busy. In the beginning it was pretty scary, for everyone but as time went by I started adapted more and more. I have been home with my three kids and helping them with digital learning since last March. I also started to get very involved in church and am now part of four amazing ministries. I also decided to come back to school which feels amazing. It was loadful of work but I enjoy every minute of it!/p>
